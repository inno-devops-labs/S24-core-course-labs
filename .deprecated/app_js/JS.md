## Best Practices and Coding Standards

In the development of the JavaScript code for the web application, several best practices and coding standards were adhered to, ensuring code quality and maintainability.

- Asynchronous JavaScript: Asynchronous JavaScript technique is employed to update the time dynamically without blocking the main thread
- Modularization: The code is organized into separate files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`), following the modularization principle
- Use of addEventListener: Event delegation is utilized through the addEventListener method to ensure that the JavaScript code is executed only after the DOM content is fully loaded (DOMContentLoaded event)
