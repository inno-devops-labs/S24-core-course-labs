# `web_app` Ansible Role

The `web_app` Ansible role is designed for deploying your application's Docker image. It follows best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing `docker` role. Below, you'll find details on how to use and configure the `web_app` role.

## Requirements

Before using the `web_app` role, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Ansible Installed**:
   - Make sure Ansible is installed on your control machine.

2. **Docker Role Dependency**:
   - The `web_app` role depends on the `docker` role. Ensure that the `docker` role is included in your playbook.

## Usage

1. **Include the `web_app` Role**:
   - In your playbook (e.g., `main.yml`), include the `web_app` role alongside the `docker` role:

     ```yaml
     - name: Deploy Application
       hosts: my_servers
       gather_facts: yes

       roles:
         - docker
         - web_app
     ```

2. **Configure Variables**:
   - Define variables specific to your application in the `defaults/main.yml` file of the `web_app` role.
   - Example variables:

     ```yaml
     # defaults/main.yml
     ---
     web_app_image_name: "myapp:latest"
     web_app_port: 5000
     # Add other relevant variables
     ```

3. **Execute the Playbook**:
   - Run your playbook to deploy both the `docker` and `web_app` roles:

     ```
     ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini site.yml
     ```

4. **Optional: Wipe Logic**:
   - If needed, enable the wipe process by setting `web_app_full_wipe: true` in your inventory or extra variables.

## Wipe Logic (Optional)

The `web_app` role includes a wipe logic section. When enabled, it stops the Docker container and removes related files. To trigger the wipe process, use the `web_app_full_wipe` variable.

## Customization

Customize the `docker-compose.yml` template and other configurations in the `web_app` role according to your application's requirements.
