1. Define your playbook:

    ```yaml
    - hosts: all
        roles:
            - role: docker
            become: true
            - role: web_app
            become: true
       
        vars:
            ansible_ssh_private_key_file: "~/.ssh/id_ed25519"
    ```

2. Define inventory file (`inventory/hosts.yml`):

    ```yaml
    all:
      hosts:
        host1:
          ansible_host: 158.160.61.228
          ansible_user: ubuntu
