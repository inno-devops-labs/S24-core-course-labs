## Selected library 
I have chosen `net/http`, because of the several reasons:

1. *Simplicity*: this library performs all what I want! I want to show cat to the user!
2. *Built in*: Standard library.
3. *Great documentation*: I have never try go, so the simplicity and well documentation of `net/http` were the killer features for my.

## Best practices 
I have used several best practices in my implementation:

1. *Coding standards and quality*: according to Go website.
2. *Requirements*: all from the box! 
3. *Code documentation*: The code is documented using comments to improve the understanding of the person who just came across my implementation of what the function does.
4. *Error handling*: The user will see the error page if error happened.## Testing

## Testing
The application was test by myself. I was the QA and the tester!

## Code Quality
As was said, I used go standard for app writing.
