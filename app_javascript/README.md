# Node.js Express Web Application Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the Node.js web application developed using the Express framework.

## Overview

The web application's primary functionality is to display the current time in Moscow. Leveraging the power of Express, it establishes a straightforward web server in Node.js and utilizes Luxon's DateTime class to fetch and format the present time.

## Code Structure

The application consists of a single JavaScript file:

- `app.js`: This file encapsulates the core logic for the Express web application. It orchestrates the import of essential modules, creates an instance of the Express application, and establishes a route to handle requests to the root URL (/). Upon receiving a request at this route, a callback function executes, fetching the current time in Moscow and responding accordingly.

## Implementation Details

### Express Application Initialization

- The Express web application is initialized by importing the `express` module and creating an Express application instance using `express()`.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
```

### Define Route for Homepage

- The route `/` is defined using `app.get('/')`. This method specifies a callback function to be executed when a GET request is made to the root URL.

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // code
});
```

### Current Time Retrieval

- Within the route handler function, the application leverages Luxon's DateTime class to fetch the current time in Moscow and format it.

```javascript
const moscowTime = DateTime.now()
  .setZone("Europe/Moscow")
  .toLocaleString(DateTime.DATETIME_FULL);
```

### Sending Response

- The retrieved current time in Moscow is sent as a response to the client using `res.send()`.

```javascript
res.send(`<h1>Current Time in Moscow:</h1><p>${moscowTime}</p>`);
```

### Running the Express Application

- The Express application launches and listens on port 3000, with the option to use the environment variable for dynamic port assignment.

```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
// Starting the server and logging its URL to the console
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### Docker

#### Containerized Application

The application is containerized using Docker, ensuring portability and ease of deployment across different environments. Below are instructions for building, pulling, and running the Docker container.

#### How to Build

To build the Docker image locally, follow these steps:

```bash
docker build -t mtz_js .
```

This command builds the Docker image based on the provided Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) in the `app_javascript` directory and tags it with the name `mtz_js`.

#### How to Pull

If you prefer to pull the pre-built Docker image from a container registry instead of building it locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker pull wesamnaseer/mtz_js
```

#### How to Run

Once you have either built the Docker image locally or pulled it from a registry, you can run the container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e PORT=3000 wesamnaseer/mtz_js
```
