## CI Best Practices

In both Docker and Python workflows, several best practices were implemented to enhance efficiency and maintainability:

### Docker Workflow

- Utilized Docker `buildx` to leverage advanced build capabilities
- Employed `cache-to` and `cache-from` options to cache Docker layers between workflow runs, reducing build time 
- Integrated Docker Hub login to securely push Docker images

### Python Workflow

- Cached Python dependencies using GitHub Actions caching mechanism, optimizing dependency installation
- Incorporated linting with Flake8 and testing with Pytest to ensure code quality and reliability
