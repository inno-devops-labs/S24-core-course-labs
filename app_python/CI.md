### Best practices

1. **Dependency caching**: Caching Python dependencies to reduce build times by storing dependencies between workflow runs. This is achieved by caching the `~/.cache/pip` directory and using a cache key based on the operating system and a hash of the `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Environment setup**: Setting up the Python environment with the specified version using `actions/setup-python@v2`. This ensures a consistent environment for building and testing the project.

3. **Code linting**: Using `flake8` to perform code linting, which checks the Python code for style and syntax errors. This helps maintain code quality and consistency across the project.

4. **Unit testing**: Running unit tests with `python -m unittest` to ensure that the code behaves as expected and to catch any regressions introduced by new changes.

5. **Vulnerability scanning**: Integrating Snyk for vulnerability scanning of project dependencies. This helps identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in the project dependencies.

6. **Docker image build and push**: Building a Docker image using the Dockerfile in the `app_python` directory and pushing it to Docker Hub. This allows for easy deployment and distribution of the application.
