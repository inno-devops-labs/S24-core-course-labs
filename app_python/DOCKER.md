## Docker best practicies that I used in lab 2

1. Starting with official base images
2. Organizing the Dockerfile into distinct layers for better performance
3. Add COPY command to cash unchanged directories and save time for building
4. Specifying version tags for reproducibility
5. Employing multi-stage builds to separate dependencies
6. Use Docker hub for cimplifying sharing and setup with other users
