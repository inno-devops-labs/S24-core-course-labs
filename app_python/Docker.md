## Introduction

The Dockerfile for the Moscow Time web application follows Docker best practices to ensure efficiency, security, and maintainability. This document highlights key practices employed in the Dockerfile.

## Best Practices

### Minimize Image Layers

To minimize the image size and optimize caching, the Dockerfile combines multiple commands into a single RUN instruction where possible. This reduces the number of intermediate layers.

### Use a Minimal Base Image

The Dockerfile utilizes a minimal base image to reduce the attack surface and overall image size. Choosing a slim and secure base image is crucial for production-ready containers.

### Clean Up Unnecessary Files

Intermediate build artifacts and unnecessary files are removed within the Dockerfile to ensure a clean and minimal final image. This reduces the risk of including sensitive information and unnecessary dependencies.

### Specify a User

To enhance security, a non-root user is specified in the Dockerfile. This principle of least privilege restricts potential damage in case of a security breach.

### Expose Only Necessary Ports

The Dockerfile explicitly exposes only the necessary ports for the Moscow Time web application. This limits the exposure of unnecessary services and enhances security.

### Use Environment Variables

Sensitive information and configuration parameters are passed through environment variables, enhancing flexibility and security. This allows for easy configuration changes without modifying the Dockerfile.

### Health Checks

A health check is implemented in the Dockerfile to ensure that the application is running correctly. This improves reliability and enables Docker to manage the application's lifecycle effectively.

### Optimize Dockerfile Order

The order of commands in the Dockerfile is optimized to take advantage of Docker's layer caching mechanism. Frequent changes are placed toward the end of the Dockerfile to maximize cache reuse.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these Docker best practices, the Moscow Time web application's Dockerfile ensures a secure, efficient, and maintainable containerized environment.
