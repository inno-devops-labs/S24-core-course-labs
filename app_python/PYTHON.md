### Framework

I decided to choose Flask because it's a small and lightweight web framework. This framework is highly flexible and has a large community.

### Best Practises

* PEP 8 - document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code\
* .gitignore - file is a text file that instructs Git to ignore certain files or folders in a project\

### Coding Standards

* Use Pylint for checking for errors and enforces a coding standard
* Use pre-commit, black and isort for formatting code

### Unit tests

2 unit tests for testing:
* Data response from server
* Time increasing after some delay
