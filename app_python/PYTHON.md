# Python Web Application Documentation

## Best Practices Applied

### Use of Flask Blueprints
- Utilized Flask Blueprints to organize routes and views, promoting modularity and maintainability.

### Separation of Concerns
- Separate business logic from routes.

## Coding Standards

### PEP 8 Compliance
- Ensured adherence to PEP 8 guidelines for Python code styling, enhancing readability and consistency across the codebase.

### Descriptive Variable and Function Names
- Used descriptive variable and function names to improve code clarity and maintainability.

## Testing

### Unit Testing and Best Practices

#### Unit Tests

We have created unit tests to verify the functionality of our Python code. These tests cover critical parts of our application and ensure that our code behaves as expected under various conditions. Here are some examples of the unit tests we've implemented:

1. **test_get_current_moscow_time**: This test verifies that the function returns current Moscow time.

2. **test_date_display**: This test verifies that the route return status code is 200.

## Best Practices Applied

In writing our unit tests, we have adhered to several best practices to ensure the effectiveness and maintainability of our test suite:

1. **Isolation**: We ensure that each test is isolated and does not depend on the state of other tests. This helps identify the cause of failures and keeps tests fast and reliable.

2. **Descriptive Test Names**: We use descriptive and meaningful names for our tests to clearly communicate their purpose. This makes it easier to understand the intent of each test case.

3. **Continuous Integration**: We integrate our unit tests into our continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automate the testing process. This ensures that our tests are run on every code change and helps catch regressions early.

By following these best practices, we ensure that our unit tests are effective, maintainable, and contribute to the overall quality of our Python codebase.
