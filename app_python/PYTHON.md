## Web Framework Choice

### Simplicity and Minimalism:
Flask is known for its simplicity and minimalistic approach. It provides just what you need to get started without imposing too many conventions. This is particularly beneficial for small projects where simplicity and ease of use are priorities.

### Lightweight:
Flask is a lightweight framework that doesn't come with built-in components that you may not need for a small application. This can result in a smaller codebase and better performance.

### Built-in Development Server:
Flask comes with a built-in development server that automatically reloads when changes are made to the code. This makes the development process smoother and helps in quickly testing and iterating on your application.

## Best Practices and Coding Standards

### Code Organization: 
The application follows the standard Flask application structure, separating concerns into routes, templates, and static files.

### PEP 8 Compliance:
The code adheres to PEP 8 standards for Python code styling.

### Virtual environment
Using virtual environments is considered a best practice in Python development, as it promotes code portability, reproducibility, and overall project cleanliness.
