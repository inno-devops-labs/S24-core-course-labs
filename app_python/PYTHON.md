# Why Flask is a Good Choice for This Task

In this section, I'll describe why we chose Flask as the framework for our Python web app that shows the current time in Moscow.

## Lightweight and Minimalistic

Flask is recognized for its simplicity and minimalism. It gives us exactly what we need to create a web application without adding additional features or complexity. For our unique objective of displaying the current time in Moscow, a lightweight framework like Flask is useful since it helps us to keep our code short and focused on the job at hand.

## Easy to Learn and Use

Flask is a great option for developers with different levels of experience because of its easy learning curve. Because of its simplicity, even beginners may use it, and it still offers the versatility required for more complicated applications. User-friendliness was a top concern for this lab assignment, and Flask makes it possible for us to swiftly prototype and develop the application.

## Routing and URL Handling

Flask provides an easy-to-use routing system that makes it simple to construct routes and view functions. We required a simple way to show the current time in Moscow in our application. We can map a Python function to a URL endpoint using Flask's routing system, which makes it simple to manage user requests and deliver relevant content.

## Extensibility

Flask is expandable despite its simple design. If the needs of our project change, we may quickly add more features or expansions. This scalability is important in case we decide to add more features to the application later on.

## Strong Community and Documentation

There is a thriving and active developer community for Flask. This implies that a multitude of tools, guides, and add-ons are available to assist with our development process. Furthermore, Flask has extensive and well-maintained documentation that offers precise instructions on how to use the framework.

In conclusion, Flask's simplicity, usability, routing features, extensibility, and robust community support make it a great option for our Python online application that displays the current time in Moscow. It enables us to design a targeted and effective solution for our particular job.

# Best Practices and Code Quality in My Python Web Application

In this part, I will outline the best practices I followed and the code quality measures implemented in my Python web application.

## Coding Standards

I followed these coding conventions and guidelines:

- Code formatting: To maintain uniform and readable code, I adhered to PEP 8 style requirements.
- Variable naming: To improve code readability, I gave variables and functions meaningful names.

## Code Quality

I followed these procedures to ensure the quality of my code:

- Code Reviews: In order to identify possible problems and guarantee code quality, I carried out code reviews with my teammates.

## Conclusion

I've written a functional, dependable, and maintainable Python web application by adhering to coding standards and upholding code quality. The long-term success of the project and the convenience of collaboration are enhanced by these best practices.
