# Lab 1: Python Web Application

It decide to choose Flask framework for my application.

## Best practises

### Coding Standards
The code adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code, ensuring consistency and readability. The use of clear and descriptive variable names enhances code readability.

### Error Handling
The application could benefit from adding error handling around the pytz library call to handle potential exceptions that may arise during timezone conversion.

### Debug Mode
The app.run() method is used with the debug=True parameter, which is suitable for development but should be set to False in production to prevent security vulnerabilities.

### Testing
There is unittest for testcase to maintain that the application work in a correct way. I add a test to check correctness of a getting time using regular expressions. Also, I tested it with pytest.

### Separation of Concerns
The application follows the MVC pattern by separating the presentation logic (HTML rendering) from the business logic (Python code) using templates.

### Security
Implementing CSRF protection with Flask-WTF for form submissions can enhance security and prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.

### Session Management
As the application grows in complexity, incorporating Flask-Session for session management can help maintain stateful interactions with users.

## Conclusion
By following these best practices, the web application can maintain high code quality, adhere to coding standards, and be more robust and secure as it continues to evolve.
