# Python web app for DevOps course

## Framework justification

As for the framework, I chose Fastapi, since I can easily write some APIs with
it.

## Best practices

And for the best pratices, I wrote my code according to the Python Google Code
style, used semantic variable naming and implemented test cases. Testing was
done using `pytest`
