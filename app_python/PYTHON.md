## Python Web Application - Current Time in Moscow

### Framework Choice: Flask

I chose Flask for this web application for the following reasons:

1. **Lightweight:** Flask is a lightweight framework, making it easy to set up and get started quickly.

2. **Simplicity:** Flask follows a minimalistic design philosophy, making it simple and easy to understand. This is suitable for a small project like displaying the current time.

3. **Flexibility:** Flask provides just the basics for web development, allowing developers to choose and integrate components as needed. This flexibility is beneficial for this specific application.

4. **Active Community:** Flask has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources, tutorials, and support available.


## Coding Standards, Testing, and Code Quality

### Best Practices:

1. **Modular Design:** The application follows a modular structure for better organization and reusability.

2. **Configurability:** Critical settings, such as the MSK Time timezone, are externalized for easy adjustments.

3. **Consistent Naming Conventions:** The code adheres to consistent naming conventions for improved readability.

### Testing and Code Quality:

1. **PEP 8 Compliance:** The code strictly follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python.

2. **Unit Testing:** A comprehensive suite of unit tests ensures the functionality of individual code units.

3. **Integration Testing:** Integration tests cover interactions between different components, identifying potential issues.

4. **Continuous Integration (CI):** CI is implemented to run tests automatically upon each repository update.

5. **Code Reviews:** Two pull requests have been created, promoting collaboration and code quality.

6. **Linting:** Linting tools are employed to analyze and enforce coding standards.
