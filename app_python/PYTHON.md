# Python application for displaying Moscow time
## Web framework
For this assignment I chose Flask web framework because it offers a clean and easy interface and does not bloat the code while also packing more than enough for completing the task.
## Best practices
I tried to name my variables according to the semantics and I also offer a fallback in case something goes wrong.
## Testing
I used manual testing to ensure quality.
