## Chosen framework - FastAPI

For solving this lab's task I chose FastAPI framework. The choice was made due to several reasons:

- High performance

- Simplicity

- Follows Python principles

- Suits well for small and fairly simple projects


## Best practices

- Logging is implemented using `logging` library.
- Virtual environment is used during the development, all needed dependencies stored into `requirements.txt` file.
- Formatter was used to assert the code readability.
- Templates are separated from the main app and stored in `templates` folder.

## Testing

With permission of professor, the app testing was done by manually checking and refreshing the page.

## Code quality

Code formatting was done using `Black` formatter, which assured the quality.
