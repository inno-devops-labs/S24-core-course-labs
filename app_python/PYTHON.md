# Overview of best practices & framework choice

## Best practices

- Type hints to help maintain the app
- [docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/) to test the app
- Code is formatted according to PEPs

## About framework choice

I chose [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) because the following:

- It's fast and simple to code
- It's widely [used](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#opinions) in industry
- It's blazing [fast](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#performance)
