# Python Web Application Best Practices

## Best Practices in the Web Application:

- **Modularity**: The web application is structured in a modular way, with separate routes defined for different functionalities.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The application separates concerns by having clear separation between the business logic, HTML templates, and static assets.
- **Security**: No sensitive information is exposed, and appropriate measures such as using HTTPS can be implemented for secure communication.


## Coding Standards, Testing, and Code Quality:

- **Coding Standards**: The code follows PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style and formatting. Variable names are descriptive, functions are appropriately named, and indentation is consistent.
- **Testing**: Unit tests are implemented using the `unittest` module to ensure the correctness of the application's functionality. Tests cover critical parts of the application such as routing and template rendering.
