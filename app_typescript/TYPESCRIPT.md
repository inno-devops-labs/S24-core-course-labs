# Vite React Moscow Time Web Application

## Overview
A simple Vite React Web Application that shows Moscow time from any timezone

## Framework choice
I chose React.ts framework with Vite build tool.

React.ts one of the most popular and reliable Typescript/Javascript Web framework 

Vite is a build tool that aims to provide faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects

## Best Practices
- Vite React.ts template comes with preinstalled ESLint for linting and code style
- has unit tests
- github actions with eslint and jest

## Tests
Unit tests are written using `React Testing Library (RTL)` and `Jest`

All unit tests are located in `src/tests/unit` directory

On every `push` and `pull_request` gh action runs Jest and ESLint on project
