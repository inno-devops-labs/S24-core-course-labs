## Describe and explain differences in the report

Each pod operates independently on its storage, which leads to different visit counts.

It's clear that each pod is getting a balanced number of visits and the load is divided across the different pods.

## Explain why ordering guarantees are unnecessary for your app

Because each pod works independently on its isolated file `visits.txt`. The pods do not rely on shared resources.

## Implement a way to instruct the StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel

It is done in `statefulset.yml`

by setting:

```bash
podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"
```
