## Explanations

### Difference in visits count between pods

Since the service is a StatefulSet where each pod has its own volume, the visits file is indepependent in each pod. Therefore the number of visits really depends on how many times the load balancer directed a request to the specific pod.

As load balancer directs requests to pods randomly, the visits metric is non-deterministic for each pod. However, the metrics should roughly be close to each other given enough user visits.

The number of visits could also be affected by pod failure, where load balancer does not send traffic to a broken pod until it recovers. Adding a new replica would also mean that the new pod has 0 visits. And so on.

### Explain why ordering guarantees are unnecessary for your app.

Every pod of the application is independent of the environment and could work alone. There is no logic in the application behavior related to deployment order. Therefore, there is no need for ordering guarantees.
