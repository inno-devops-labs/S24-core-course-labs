# Web Application Development

## Overview

In this lab assignment, you will develop a simple web application using Python and best practices. You will also have the opportunity to create a bonus web application using a different programming language. Follow the tasks below to complete the lab assignment.

## Task 1: Python Web Application

**To achieve a grade of 6/10**, follow these steps:

1. Create `app_python` Folder:
   - Create a folder named `app_python` to contain your Python web application files.
   - Inside the `app_python` folder, create a file named `PYTHON.md`.

2. Develop and Test Python Web Application:
   - Develop a Python web application that displays the current time in Moscow.
   - Choose a suitable framework for your web application and justify your choice in the `PYTHON.md` file.
   - Implement best practices in your code and follow coding standards.
   - Test your application to ensure the displayed time updates upon page refreshing.

## Task 2: Well Decorated Description

**To earn an additional 4 points**, follow these steps:

1. Update `PYTHON.md`:
   - Update the `PYTHON.md` file and describe all the best practices you applied to your web application.
   - Explain how you followed coding standards, implemented testing, and ensured code quality.

2. Create `README.md`:
   - Create a `README.md` file in the `app_python` folder.
   - Use a Markdown template to describe your Python web application.

## Bonus Task: Additional Web Application

**To earn an additional 2.5 points:**

1. Create `app_*` Folder:
   - Create a folder named `app_*` in the main project directory, replacing `*` with a programming language of your choice (other than Python).
   - Inside the `app_*` folder, create a file named `*`.md.

2. Develop Your Own Web App:
   - Create a web application using the programming language you chose.
   - Decide what your web application will display or do, and use your creativity.

3. Follow Main Task Steps:
   - Implement your bonus web application following the same suggestions and steps as the main Python web application task.

### Guidelines

- Use proper Markdown formatting and structure for the documentation files.
- Organize the files within the lab folder using appropriate naming conventions.
- Create a PR from your fork to the master branch of this repository and from your fork's branch to your fork's master branch with your completed lab assignment.

> Note: Apply best practices, coding standards, and testing to your Python web application. Explore creativity in your bonus web application, and document your process using Markdown.
