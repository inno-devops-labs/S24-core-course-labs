# Lab 12: Kubernetes ConfigMaps

## Overview

In this lab, you'll delve into Kubernetes ConfigMaps, focusing on managing non-confidential data and upgrading your application for persistence. ConfigMaps provide a way to decouple configuration artifacts from image content, allowing you to manage configuration data separately from the application.

## Task 1: Upgrade Application for Persistence

**6 Points:**

In this task, you'll enhance your application to persist data and explore ConfigMaps in Kubernetes.

1. Upgrade Your Application:
   - Modify your application to:
     - Implement a counter logic in your application to keep track of the number of times it's accessed.
     - Save the counter number in the `visits` file.
     - Introduce a new endpoint `/visits` to display the recorded visits.
   - Test the changes:
     - Update your `docker-compose.yml` to include a new volume with your `visits` file.
     - Verify that the enhancements work as expected, you must see the updated number in the `visits` file on the host machine.
     - Update the `README.md` for your application.

2. Create Pull Requests:
    - Submit a PR to merge your changes into the main branch of the forked repository.
    - Create a PR from the `lab12` branch to the main branch in your own repository.

## Task 2: ConfigMap Implementation

**4 Points:**

1. Understand ConfigMaps:
   - Read about ConfigMaps in Kubernetes:
     - [ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/)

2. Mount a Config File:
   - Create a `files` folder with a `config.json` file.
   - Populate `config.json` with data in JSON format.
   - Use Helm to mount `config.json`:
     - Create a `configMap` manifest, extracting data from `config.json` using `.Files.Get`.
     - Update `deployment.yaml` with `Volumes` and `VolumeMounts`.
       - [Example](https://carlos.mendible.com/2019/02/10/kubernetes-mount-file-pod-with-configmap/)
     - Install the updated Helm chart and verify success:
       - Retrieve the list of pods: `kubectl get po`.
       - Use the pod name as proof of successful deployment.
       - Check the ConfigMap inside the pod, e.g., `kubectl exec demo-758cc4d7c4-cxnrn -- cat /config.json`.

3. Documentation:
   - Create `12.md` in the `k8s` folder and include the output of relevant commands.

**List of Requirements:**

- `config.json` in the `files` folder.
- `configMap` retrieving data from `config.json` using `.Files.Get`.
- `Volume`s and `VolumeMount`s in `deployments.yml`.
- `12.md` documenting the results of commands.

## Bonus Task: ConfigMap via Environment Variables

**2.5 Points:**

1. Upgrade Bonus App:
   - Implement persistence logic in your bonus app.

2. ConfigMap via Environment Variables:
   - Utilize ConfigMap via environment variables in a running container using the `envFrom` property.
   - Provide proof with the output of the `env` command inside your container.

### Guidelines

- Maintain clear and organized documentation.
- Use appropriate naming conventions for files and folders.
- For your repository PR, ensure it's from the `lab12` branch to the main branch.

> Note: Clear documentation is crucial to demonstrate successful data persistence and ConfigMap utilization in Kubernetes. Explore the bonus tasks to further enhance your skills.
