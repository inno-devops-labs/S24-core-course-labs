## Best practicies:
Hereâ€™s the shuffled version:

1. **Provider Configuration**:  
Providers are set apart from resources for better readability.

2. **Outputs**:  
Key outputs with descriptions are provided, accessible via interpolation.

3. **Resource Declarations**:  
Resources have clear names and use interpolation, with good formatting.

4. **Terraform Configuration**:  
Providers and version constraints are specified to ensure compatibility.

5. **Variable Definitions**:  
Each variable is clearly described with defaults where needed, and types are set for clarity.

## Docker:
 - terraform state list:

```bash
(venv) smasiner@smasIners-MacBook-Pro docker_terraform % terraform state list
docker_container.webapp_container
docker_image.webapp_image
```
 - terraform show:
```bash
(venv) smasiner@smasIners-MacBook-Pro docker_terraform % terraform state show docker_container.webapp_container
