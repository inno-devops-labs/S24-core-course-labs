## Utilize input variables to rename your Docker container.

To do it, you can execute the following command:

```bash
terraform apply -var "container_name=YetAnotherName"
```

After that, you can see (using `docker ps`) that the container has new name: **YetAnotherName**

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                  NAMES

```

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

twc_ssh_key.timeweb-ssh-key: Creating...
twc_ssh_key.timeweb-ssh-key: Creation complete after 1s [id=159307]
twc_server.my-timeweb-server: Creating...
twc_server.my-timeweb-server: Creation complete after 4s [id=2600843]

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

instance_id = "2600843"
instance_public_ip = "185.104.113.100"
```

## Utilize input variables to rename your Server.

To do it, you can execute the following command:

```bash
terraform apply -var "server_name=YetAnotherName"
```

After that, you can see (in the timeweb console) that the server has new name: **YetAnotherName**

## Output of `terraform output`

```bash
instance_id = "2600837"
instance_public_ip = "92.255.76.109"
```

# Terraform-related best practices

1. Use version control (Git)

2. Organize the code: use separate directories for different environments and break down your configurations into several files.

3. Use variables and outputs

4. Plan before applying.

5. Keep dependencies up to date.

6. Use environment variables for tokens.
